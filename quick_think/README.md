## Getting Started

### Contribution Guidelines

1. create a personal fork of the project repo on Github.

2. Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.

3. On your local system inside the cloned project, add the original repository as a remote called upstream.

'$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/hngi/Team-superman-IQ-Test-app.git'

4. Create a new branch to work on. It is recommended for every new feature you work on make a new branch and work from there.

5. Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.

6. Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.

7. From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's development branch.

8. To keep to update with the main repo, be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository. This way you don't miss changes

'$ git pull upstream development'
